      DS-210 Final Project by Thomas Kwashnak

      <p>
        For my final in my DS-210 Course at Quinnipiac University, I chose to explore creating a simple neural network. I chose to make my neural network take in a game-state of the game "Connect-4", and predict whether or not a given player will win.
      </p>
      <p>
        With no prior experience with neural networks, I learned a lot about the different options available when making one, as well as an insight to the math done in order to run it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this project, I used a dataset I found at the <b>UCI Machine Learning Repo</b>. You can find the dataset I used here: <a target="_blank" rel="noreferror" href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connect-4">Connect-4 Dataset</a>
